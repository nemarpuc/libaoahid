/*
 * libaoahid: HID input to an Android device over USB, through Android Open Accessory (AOA) 2.0.
 * This header is the whole stable C ABI. It exposes no libusb or C++ type.
 *
 * Objects
 *   Context   libusb and, in AOAHID_EVENT_INTERNAL_THREAD mode, one event thread.
 *   Device    one USB device opened on a Context.
 *   Spec      an immutable HID report descriptor and report layout, built by a factory
 *             (aoahid_spec_create_*). It needs no device and is reference counted.
 *   Node      a Spec registered on a Device as one AOA HID, with the state its input calls
 *             change (aoahid_keyboard_key, aoahid_touchscreen_contact, ...). A Node sends a
 *             report when it is submitted.
 *   Channel   a Bulk IN/OUT interface of a Device, such as ADB, read and written as a stream.
 *
 * Rules every function follows
 *   Results    Every call records the details of its result for the calling thread, read with
 *              aoahid_last_error(). Results that come from USB (the "transport errors") are
 *              AOAHID_ERR_UNSUPPORTED, _ACCESS, _BUSY, _NO_DEVICE, _STALL, _TIMEOUT,
 *              _SHORT_TRANSFER, _IO and _OVERFLOW; error_detail.transport_status holds the libusb
 *              status. A report transfer fails after the call that queued it has returned, so its
 *              error is returned by a later call on the same Node, Device or Context. Any call can
 *              also return AOAHID_ERR_INTERNAL (an allocation failed or an internal invariant
 *              broke). The Returns lines below list what is particular to each function.
 *   Outputs    A function that creates an object returns it through an out_* pointer, which is
 *              set to null first and stays null when the call fails.
 *   Closing    The *_close and *_destroy functions follow one rule:
 *                AOAHID_ERR_PARAM or AOAHID_ERR_UNSET_FIELD  nothing was done; the handle is still
 *                                                           the caller's.
 *                AOAHID_CLOSE_PENDING                       a transfer of the object is still in
 *                                                           flight; the handle is still the
 *                                                           caller's: call again later.
 *                any other result                           the object is gone and its handle must
 *                                                           not be used again. An error says what
 *                                                           failed on the way out.
 *   Threads    A Context and every Device, Node and Channel on it form one domain: the caller
 *              makes sure no two calls in a domain run at the same time, unless a function says
 *              otherwise. Specs and Discovery snapshots are outside any domain. A log sink must
 *              not call back into the library.
 *   Timeouts   The library keeps no timeout: every call that can wait takes its timeouts in
 *              milliseconds as arguments. A control, send or drain timeout of zero is refused with
 *              AOAHID_ERR_UNSET_FIELD before anything is done. AOAHID_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS and the
 *              constants next to it are values that work.
 *   Structures Each options structure starts with struct_size (its sizeof) and reserved (zero).
 *              Its *_init function sets both and fills in working values. A required field that
 *              is zero is refused, and every enumeration starts at 1, so a field left zero never
 *              selects something by accident. A flag (enable_*, down, ...) is exactly 0 or 1.
 *
 * Specifications cited: HID 1.11 and HID Usage Tables 1.7 (HUT) from usb.org, and AOA 2.0:
 * https://source.android.com/docs/core/interaction/accessories/aoa2
 * docs/API.md is the guide to this header.
