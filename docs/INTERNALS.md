# Internals

How the implementation behind `include/aoahid.h` works: which object owns
what, which lock guards what, and what runs on each path. It is for people
changing the library. The public model is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md),
the wire protocol in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md), and every limit in
[LIMITS.md](LIMITS.md); this page does not repeat them.

Source references are `path#Lnnn` and are valid at v4.0.5. They name the line
where the symbol starts.

## Handles

| Handle | Definition | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aoahid_context` | `src/api/internal.hpp#L269` | The `Runtime` (libusb context), the event thread, `devices`, `graveyard`, the HID ID domains, and the deferred error latch. |
| `aoahid_device` | `src/api/internal.hpp#L301` | A `transport::Device` (transfer pool and one `Port` reference), its policy values, `nodes`, `channels`, and the pool-slot signal. |
| `aoahid_node` | `src/api/internal.hpp#L340` | A retained Spec, the `NodeState` variant, the HID ID, the pool reservation, and the completion fields the callback publishes. |
| `aoahid_channel` | `src/api/internal.hpp#L335` | A `transport::Channel` (its own transfers and one `Port` reference). |
| `aoahid_spec` | `src/api/internal.hpp#L258` | An atomic reference count, the descriptor bytes, the `ReportLayout`, the `DescriptorRequirements`, and the copied options. |

A `Port` (`src/transport/transport.hpp#L124`) is the only owner
of a libusb device handle. A Device and each of its Channels hold one
reference; the handle closes when the last is released, which each holder does
only after its own transfers have drained. `Device::open` always opens a new
handle through `src/transport/port.cpp#L109`.
The Runtime's Port list exists so discovery and `start_accessory` can probe a
device that is already open through its existing handle.

No libusb type appears above `src/transport/transport.hpp`.

## Locks

| Lock | Guards | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aoahid_context::mutex` | `devices`, `graveyard`, `deferred_error`, `event_thread_error` | Taken through `active_state_mutex`, which is null in caller-poll mode, so `src/api/internal.hpp#L225` locks nothing there. |
| `aoahid_node::completion_mutex` | The hand-over of a completion to a thread blocked in `aoahid_node_submit_blocking` | Also the callback-exit barrier Node close takes. Null in caller-poll mode. |
| `aoahid_device::slot_mutex` | The wait for a free pool slot | `slot_generation` is bumped by every report completion. |
| Transport `StateGuard` (`src/transport/transport.cpp#L141`) | The transfer pool: `free_stack`, reservations, `outstanding`, `callbacks_active`, the Device error latch | An `atomic_flag` spinlock. `libusb_submit_transfer` is called while it is held. |
| `Runtime::ports_mutex_`, `Port::claims_mutex_` | The open-Port list; the per-interface claim counts | Leaf locks, open and close paths only. |

Order: the Context mutex is taken before the transport spinlock
(`src/api/c_api.cpp#L908` calls `graph_drained` under it).
Nothing takes them the other way round.

Profile calls need no lock: a mutator returns `AOAHID_ERR_BUSY` while
`transfer_inflight` is set (`src/profiles/state.cpp#L63`),
so the event thread and the application never write Node state at the same
time.

## Event thread

Internal-thread mode starts one thread in
`src/api/c_api.cpp#L1057`. Its loop is
`Runtime::poll(60 s)` followed by `reap_graveyard`
(`src/api/c_api.cpp#L26`).
A failed poll latches a Context error and backs off 10 ms on `graveyard_cv`.

`src/transport/discovery.cpp#L178` is one
`libusb_handle_events_timeout_completed`. An interrupted wait counts as
success.

Stopping sets `stop_event_thread`, then calls
`src/transport/discovery.cpp#L172`, then
joins (`src/api/c_api.cpp#L234`). The 60-second
timeout only bounds a backend that ignores the interrupt.

The log sink can run on the event thread. Exceptions from it are swallowed.

## Send path

Per report, in internal-thread mode:

1. A profile call changes `NodeState` and marks the Node dirty. Press and
   release of one control cannot share a report: the second edge returns
   `AOAHID_ERR_BUSY` until a report carrying the first has completed.
2. `src/api/c_api.cpp#L1599` runs
   `preflight_context`, which reads the `event_thread_failed` atomic and then
   checks the deferred error latch under the Context mutex
   (`src/api/c_api.cpp#L209`).
3. `src/transport/transport.cpp#L652` pops a slot
   from `free_stack` (last in, first out). A slot is handed out only while
   more are free than other Nodes have reserved, unless the caller is filling
   its own reservation. Per acquire only wValue (HID ID) and wLength are
   written; the rest of the setup packet was written at open.
4. `src/profiles/state.cpp#L318` writes the report
   into the slot buffer. With `validate_reports` it is decoded again by
   `src/profiles/state.cpp#L265`.
5. `src/transport/transport.cpp#L286` submits the
   control transfer. In caller-poll mode `aoahid_node_submit` then runs one
   zero-timeout poll; a failure there is latched in the Context, not returned.
6. `src/profiles/state.cpp#L542` publishes
   `completion_result` and then clears `transfer_inflight`. A completed length
   other than the report length is `AOAHID_ERR_SHORT_TRANSFER`.

A STALL, or a submit libusb did not accept, keeps the state pending for a
resend: nothing was applied. Any other failed completion (a timeout, a
cancellation) may have reached the device, so a mouse report consumes the
motion it carried and motion is never sent twice.

`aoahid_node_submit_blocking` waits in
`src/api/c_api.cpp#L601`: on the Node's
`completion_cv`, or on the Device's `slot_cv` when every pool slot is taken.
Both waits wake every 10 ms to check for a Context error.

## Errors

- Two thread-local records exist: the transport's (`record_error`) and the
  API's (`set_error`). `finish_transport_result` merges them into what
  `aoahid_last_error` returns.
- An asynchronous completion error reaches the caller three ways: the Node's
  `completion_*` atomics (reported by the next submit or close), the Device
  latch (`aoahid_device_latched_error`), and the Context `deferred_error`.
- The Context latch keeps the first error only.
- An event-thread termination is stored separately in `event_thread_error`
  and is returned by every later call.
- `DeferredError` holds only string literals, so it never allocates and can
  outlive the Device it came from.

## Close and the graveyard

`src/api/c_api.cpp#L1880` marks the
Device closing, closes every Node (neutral report, request 55, reservation)
inside one `close_drain_timeout_ms` budget, loses every Channel, cancels all
transfers, and waits for them to drain.

- Drained means `outstanding == 0 && callbacks_active == 0`
  (`src/transport/transport.cpp#L819`). `callbacks_active`
  is decremented only after the completion callback returns.
- A drained Device is destroyed at once
  (`src/api/c_api.cpp#L857`).
- Otherwise the whole graph moves to `graveyard`
  (`src/api/c_api.cpp#L902`) and the call returns
  `AOAHID_CLOSE_PENDING`. The event thread reaps it after a poll returns;
  in caller-poll mode `aoahid_context_poll` and context destroy do. Nothing
  wakes the event thread for the hand-over itself: a graph whose last callback
  finished just before it is reaped at the next USB event, or when the
  60-second wait ends.
- `aoahid_device_open` reserves room in both `devices` and `graveyard`, so
  the hand-over cannot allocate.
- A `transport::Device` or `Channel` destroyed while not drained leaks its
  state on purpose: a late libusb callback must not touch freed memory.

Reaping runs synchronous control transfers (request 55) on the event thread,
between polls.

## Registration

`src/api/c_api.cpp#L970` takes the next ID of the
Device's domain (USB bus plus port path). IDs start at 1 and are never reused
while the Context lives; passing 65535 returns `AOAHID_ERR_OVERFLOW`.

`src/transport/transport.cpp#L475` sends
request 54 and then request 56 in fragments. When a request fails in a way the
device may still have accepted (timeout, I/O error, short transfer:
`src/transport/transport.cpp#L32`), a
best-effort request 55 follows. The Node is published only after success.

## Channel

`src/transport/channel.cpp#L135` owns fixed IN and OUT
slots allocated at open. `read`, `write`, and the callback never allocate.

- Completions reach the reader, and free OUT slots reach the writer, through
  single-producer single-consumer rings
  (`src/transport/channel.cpp#L29`). The callback takes
  the waiter mutex only when a thread is waiting
  (`src/transport/channel.cpp#L72`).
- Stream mode keeps `in_transfers` IN transfers submitted. Request mode has
  one IN slot and submits it from `read`, sized from the caller's capacity and
  rounded up to a whole packet; a timed-out read leaves it pending and the
  next read waits for the same transfer.
- `write` returns once every byte is queued. An OUT completion error is
  stored and returned once by the next `write`. Only `LIBUSB_TRANSFER_NO_DEVICE`
  marks the Channel lost from the OUT side; any failed IN transfer does.
- A lost Channel cancels its transfers and every later call returns
  `AOAHID_ERR_NO_DEVICE`.
- Open selects configuration 1 only when the device is unconfigured: setting
  the active configuration again resets the device (see Sources).
  `aoahid_channel_open` first waits for report transfers to drain.

Behavior to know before changing it:

- The packet size used for rounding and for the zero-length packet rule is
  the larger of the IN and OUT `wMaxPacketSize`
  (`src/transport/channel.cpp#L259`).
- A halted endpoint is not cleared: the library never calls
  `libusb_clear_halt`.
- In stream mode, when a later IN submit fails during open while an earlier
  one is in flight, open returns `AOAHID_OK` for a Channel that is already
  lost; the first read reports `AOAHID_ERR_NO_DEVICE`.

## Descriptor generation

`src/profiles/spec.cpp#L155` runs the same
emit function twice: once counting into null storage, once writing into a
buffer of exactly that size. The count is capped at 65535 bytes, the 16-bit
AOA length (`src/profiles/spec.cpp#L24`).

- `src/hid/item_writer.cpp#L59` and
  `src/hid/item_writer.cpp#L69` write short items
  of 0, 1, 2, or 4 data bytes. Minimum items are signed. A Maximum is unsigned
  when both extents are non-negative.
- `src/hid/descriptor_builder.cpp#L190` adds
  one field and its `FieldLayout` entry (semantic, bit offset, width, range).
  Since 4.0.4 it first pads to the next byte boundary when the field would
  otherwise touch a fifth byte.
- `src/profiles/spec.cpp#L142` pads to a byte boundary at the
  fixed points listed in LIMITS.md.
- `src/hid/validator.cpp#L214` parses the
  result again and checks it against the layout.
- `DescriptorRequirements` records what the descriptor needs of the target
  parser (usages, fields per report, report bits). `aoahid_node_open` compares
  it with the Device's `linux_hid_*_policy` values.

`src/profiles/state.cpp#L83` writes a value little-endian at
its layout offset and rejects one outside the logical range, except the null
value of a Null State field.

## State machines

- Every profile keeps transition marks for edges not yet reported. A report
  completion consumes them.
- Mouse deltas are 64-bit pending totals. A report carries what fits the
  field range; the rest stays pending.
- Touch state is a fixed array of 16 contacts with phases none, down, and up.
  A contact that was lifted still occupies its slot until the report carrying
  the lift completes, so placing one more than `maximum_contacts` returns
  `AOAHID_ERR_OVERFLOW`.
- With multi-packet frames the Node stays busy until the last packet of the
  frame has completed.
- A pen that changes tool while in range first sends one out-of-range report.
- The toggle profile holds one Usage at a time.

## Tests and checks

- `tests/fake_libusb/` implements the libusb calls the transport uses. It is
  linked only with `AOAHID_USE_FAKE_LIBUSB=ON`, which `AOAHID_BUILD_TESTS=ON`
  requires.
- `aoahid_tests` runs the suites named on its command line (`item_writer`,
  `profiles`, `transport`, `identity`).
- `tests/golden/*.hex` are the expected descriptors. A generator change that
  alters one of them changes what existing callers put on the wire.
- `tests/abi/` and `tools/check_bindings.py` compare the C struct layout with
  the layout oracle and with the Python, C#, and Rust bindings.
- CI formats with clang-format 14 and lints with clang-tidy 14; a newer
  clang-format lays out some lines differently.
- The `tsan` preset builds the tests and the C examples with ThreadSanitizer.

## Version and release

- `tools/release/version_files.py` lists every file that carries the version.
  `tools/release/sync_version.py X.Y.Z` writes them all;
  `tools/release/validate_release.py` rejects a tag whose files disagree or
  whose `CHANGELOG.md` has no dated section.
- Each CHANGELOG section states whether the release was verified on hardware.
- A pushed `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds and
  publishes the GitHub Release. The PyPI and NuGet jobs run only when the
  repository variable `AOAHID_PUBLISH_BINDINGS` is `true`.
- Downstream projects pin a libaoahid release by tag in their own CI, and
  download its release assets, so a tag must exist before they can move to it.
